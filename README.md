  ##BUGS
  1.) When one registers on the frontend, either as an admin or a user, the navbar does not display the person's name right away. You have to logout first and then login again. - THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH REDUX AND LOCAL STORAGE, if I had more time, I would request a fresh call from the mongoDb database instead of storing the existing data into local storage\
  2.) When one logs out , the react code attempts to read an object containing userInfo, which isn't there anymore, so an error occurs after log out- I would have done a setTimeout before the reading took place once more, if I had some extra time\
  

 1.) Go To the root directory and run your package manager with the "dev" command (e.g npm run dev)\
 2.) Type npm run client to run only the client, or npm run server to run only the API\
 
  ## THINGS OF NOTE 

 1.) Redux is used here for state managenent(store, provider,reducers and actions), which allows for scaling of this application\
 2.) A Carousel of top products is displayed in the frontend, as a UI feature to aid users (it just collects products from the same location as the products displayed below it.\
 3.) Passwords are stored as hashes in the database and decrypted with Bcrypt library (as a way to protect our uses information from being compromised\
 4.) Pagination Requests for Items from the database, 3 items at a time, for a less clustered display.\
 5.) There is a search bar in the UI functions only to take users to the product page of the item they searched for. It does not work to single out products to edit\
